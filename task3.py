stars = "*" #can easily just print ("*" * num) later on but kept this in



#basic for loop would print numbers 1-5 (6 exclusive) and it was simply a matter of converting the integers to stars
for num in range(1, 6):
    print(stars * num)






print(type(num)) #showing myself num is an integer without having to specify earlier on...




'''for num in range(6):
    print(stars * num)''' #also works same as range(1-6); just not to self...
